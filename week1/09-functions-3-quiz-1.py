Build a quiz program.  This program is in two parts.
Complete part 1 first and then move on to part 2.

Part 1) Generate a quiz based on user input.  

The script will ask the user for a question and an answer and store that information.

Example:
	Terminal prompts user: "Please enter a question:"
	User responds: "What is the only island in the Caribbean to have a railroad?"
	Terminal prompts user: "Please enter an answer:"
	User responds: "Cuba"

Store the user input for their question / answer pair. Decide what data structure to user to store that user input. (array? dictionary?)

The script should ask for 2 sets of questions and answers. Another example run is shown below:

	Program: Enter the question text for question 1: 
	User: What's the Only Fruit to Have its Seeds on the Outside?

	Program: Enter the answer text for question 1:
	User: strawberries

Now you store that pair of information, and ask the user for question 2.

	Program: Enter the question text for question 2: 
	User: How many cards are there in a standard deck of playing cards?

	Program: Enter the answer text for question 2:
	User: 52


In a well named function, assign both pieces of information that you have asked for into one variable and return it. 

Keep in mind that in the future you could have to store way more then two question/answer pairs. This means that you should loop through your question / answer prompting while saving the user's data, so that the number of times you loop through prompting for Q/A pairs is flexible.

Part 2)

Write code that takes the data structure returned from the function in part one, iterates through it, and quizzes the user with those generated Q/A pairs.
Compare the new quiz answers to the answers listed in the part one data structure. Tell the new user if they were correct or incorrect after they have answered the question, before asking them the next question.

Example Run:

	Program: Question 1: What's the Only Fruit to Have its Seeds on the Outside?

	User: strawberries

	Program: Correct!

	Program: Question 2: How many cards are there in a standard deck of playing cards?

	User: 51

	Program: Wrong!
