Here are the specifications for the ice-breaker game:

1) The game asks 6 questions in the terminal.  The user will type in the answer/response.

2) Based on the response, the game calculates points (add one point for each correct answer)

3) If points greater than 3, print let's be friends, else print we need to work on our relationship

4) Ask your neighbor to play your game and see how many points they score...

Bonus: Think about weird cases to handle (uppercase, lowercase, etc)!

This time around, use Arrays/Hashes as your data store.
