Commands:
n - creates a new bill, asks user for the name of the bill
l - lists ALL the bills
d - deletes a bill


a - User enters "Garden Salad" - this gets added to the bill:
	Two ways to do this:
		* when the total is populated, it goes back to look up all the prices and adds them together
		* when the item is stored, the price is stored as well and you keep a running total

r- removes item from bill
s- shows items in bill

tips:
