Build a simple user info database.

'''

#create a function that asks a user for three pieces of information, first name, city, age. store the data in an array [name,city,age].


#create a function that uses the previous function to ask 3 people for their info (use a for loop).  for each person you store first name, city, age. use only arrays. this function should return an array with all the user data (hint: use an array of arrays [[name,city,age],[name,city,age],[name,city,age]]).


#create a function that takes the result from the previous function and prints out all the user data.
#Ex: User 1 - First Name: Bob, Age: 76, City: Bethesda
#(tip: doesn't have to be printed out in one line)
