'''
 Write a program that finds prime numbers between a and b (any integer)

 Here are some things to consider:Use nested loops

 Here is the general structure of the program

 1) For x in range a to b

 2) For y in range 2 to x

 3) If the remainder of x divided by y is equal to 0 => move on to the next number

 4) Else print

 Tip: Consider using a counter/flag variable (i.e. a variable that is True or False that keeps track of whether the number is prime or not)

 Trace it through first 10+ steps
