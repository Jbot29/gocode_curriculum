Part 3: Extension of budget app (optional)

1) Use hashes instead of if/else statements in the main while loop that runs the program (e.g. {"o":open_file,"s":save_file,"a":append_data} - each value is a function name.)

2) When the user opens a file, store the filename so that the user does not have to re-type it in when saving

3) Allow users to define column names in the file

4) Allow users to add/remove columns in the csv file
