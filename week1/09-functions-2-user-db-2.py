#create a new function that asks the user for the same three pieces of information but this time store the data in an dictionary (hint: {age: 1,name:'asdf',city:'test'}.

#create a new function to ask for data from 3 users using the function above (use a for loop). return an array of hashes (hint: [{age: 1,name:'asdf',city:'test'},{age: 1,name:'asdf',city:'test'}])

#create a new function that prints out all the user data
#Ex: User 1 - First Name: Bob, Age: 76, City: Bethesda
#(doesn't have to be printed out in one line)
