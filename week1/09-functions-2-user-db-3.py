Build a simple user info database.


'''


#Create a new function to ask 3 users for data using the previous function in exercise two that returns a dictionary for a single user.  This new function will return a dictionary. Each user dictionary should be stored under the key of that user's name. Example {'Bob': {age: 1,name:'asdf',city:'test'},'Susan': {age: 1,name:'asdf',city:'test'}....


#create a function to print out the new dictionary-based user data.
#Ex: User 1 - First Name: Bob, Age: 76, City: Bethesda
#(doesn't have to be printed out in one line)
