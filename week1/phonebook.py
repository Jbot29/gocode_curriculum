Create an app that acts like a phonebook:

A user can:
Add a name and phone number 
List all of the names and phone numbers in the phonebook
Look up a phone number by the person's name
Remove a person from the phonebook

tips:
Plan out how to write/structure this code in english
Think of what data structure to use for storing the name and phone number of the phonebook
use functions to break up the tasks, does the function take a parameter? Does the function return something? 
If so,What does the function return?
