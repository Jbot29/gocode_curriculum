A CSV file is a file format that lets you exchange data between similar applications that display spreadsheets. CSV stands for Comma Separated Values. You can use CSV files with Excel, OpenOffice Calc and so on. 

You can open(), read() and write() to CSV files using a python script, just as we did with .txt files.
If you write a string that has commas and newlines ( looks like this: \n ) in it to a csv file, it will display in spreadsheet applications with commas denoting new columns and newlines denoting new rows.  


Create a program that asks a user for data and a filename and saves it into a two row csv. 

First write the csv header, which is just one line with a list of fields "Name,Age,City\n" 

The program will ask for the user's name, age and city. Every peice of information the user gives will be separated with a comma. The information they have given will be written to a csv file as a string separated by commas. 

Open your csv file in a spreadsheet application and see what it looks like.

If you don't remember the exact syntax for editing files, make yourself a cheatsheet for this assignment based off of what you learned in file-io-1 and file-io-2
