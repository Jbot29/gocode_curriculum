A very common data strucutre is a linked list. It is away of creating a list of data when you don't
know the size of the array ahead of time.

Python does this internally for many data structures.

We can easily mimic them in Python with a class.

A linked list has nodes.

Each node can have a value, and then a pointer or link to the next node. 


1) write as functions or possibly methods


2) print all the nodes, can be done recursively or iteratively 


3) add node - takes a root and find then end, add a new node to the end.


4) insert - takes a root, and new node, and a value to find, when found it inserts that value before
#i.e. 1 -> 3. insert LL(2) to make 1->2->3


5) remove takes the root, and a value to remove from the list

6) Search and find a node data

class LL():
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = None
        self.next = None



root = LL()
root.value = 1

next_value = LL()
next_value.value = 2

root.next = next_value
