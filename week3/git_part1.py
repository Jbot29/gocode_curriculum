'''Introduction To Git

Working on complex software projects involves many files. When work is done on the project, these files are in a state of flux: some change frequently, some rarely. Some have strong interdependencies, and others do not.

Because all these changes are taking place, the problem of understanding what changes are taking place is enormous without tools to help. Git is one such tool, and arguably the most important of all of them in a developer's toolkit.

Even in an environment where only one developer is working, these changes are challenging to track. When files come in to conflict, it can be hard to remember what you changed where. And more often, more than one person is working on the project, often on the same file, and at worst, on the same files at the same time. Without a management tool, there would be chaos.

Git is a repository that saves versioned states of a project, and allows collaborations between multiple contributors. You'll be introduced to Git as a simple repository at first. In later units, we'll add features as our projects demand it.

# 1) Complete git_intro exercise here: https://gist.github.com/jhylau/2caebb1e77a9af96f1d7

# 2) Go back and clean up your code from week 1 -3.  Create a git repository for all the good code that you want to show employers.
# Portfolio projects include: Content Indexing Engine, File IO CSV Budget App, Blackjack Game, Optionally: Recursion and Tree exercises.
# No need to include the basic assignments 1-9 in the portfolio as that is too simple.

# 3) Add comments to your portfolio projects so that it is easy for someone to scan through your logic

# 4) Commit your files to your git repository and push it to your public github folder

# 5) You will need these two guide docs to setup your github account/repo:
