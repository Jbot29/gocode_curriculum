Another example of recursion is binary recursion.  Binary recursion is when two recursive calls are made to the function (i.e. the function calls itself twice).  The fibonacci problem is a common problem that can be solved using binary recursion.

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers of the following sequence of integer values: 

0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89, ... 

The Fibonacci numbers are defined by: 

Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 
with F0 = 0 and F1 = 1 

The Fibonacci sequence is named after the mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, who is better known as Fibonacci. In his book "Liber Abaci" (publishes 1202) he introduced the sequence as an exercise dealing with bunnies.

The Fibonacci numbers are easy to write as a Python function. It's more or less a one to one mapping from the mathematical definition:
